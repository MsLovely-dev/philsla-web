# API Endpoints

## Current state

The baseline health endpoint is implemented. The frontend currently uses mock/local services, and every business path below remains a capability inventory rather than an approved contract. OpenAPI 3 through DRF Spectacular is the accepted machine-readable contract approach after [ADR-014](../decisions/ADR-014-API-SCHEMA-TOOLING-AND-PUBLICATION.md), but schema tooling is not installed yet.

## Implemented baseline endpoints

| Method | Path | Authentication | Permission | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/health/` | Public; no credentials required | `AllowAny` | Safe service liveness smoke check | Implemented |

### `GET /api/v1/health/`

Use this endpoint for local smoke tests and lightweight service liveness checks.

Request:

- Body: none.
- Query parameters: none.
- Authentication: none.

Successful response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Response behavior:

- `200 OK` returns only the static health status payload above.
- The response deliberately excludes database status, storage status, dependency status, infrastructure internals, secrets, credentials, hostnames, connection strings, and environment details.
- Supported response format follows the project JSON-only API baseline.
- Responses include the standard `X-Correlation-ID` header.
- CORS headers are returned only when the request origin is configured as allowed.
- Unsupported methods use the standard API error envelope with `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`.

Test coverage:

- Behavior tests: `backend/apps/core/tests/test_health.py`.
- Contract guard: `backend/apps/core/tests/test_api_contract.py`.

## Candidate endpoint groups

| Capability | Candidate base path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication and sessions | `/api/v1/auth` | `TBD` |
| Student registration/applications | `/api/v1/applications` | `TBD` |
| Student and registry verification | `/api/v1/verifications` | `TBD` |
| Assessments and question banks | `/api/v1/assessments` | `TBD` |
| Exam schedules, attempts, responses | `/api/v1/exams` | `TBD` |
| Proctoring sessions and incidents | `/api/v1/proctoring` | `TBD` |
| Scores and result release | `/api/v1/results` | `TBD` |
| Administrative users/configuration | `/api/v1/administration` | `TBD` |
| External integrations | `/api/v1/integrations` | `TBD` |
| Authorized audit queries | `/api/v1/audit-events` | `TBD` |

Do not implement from this table alone. For each endpoint, approve the actor, authorization rule, request/response schema, validation, state transition, idempotency/concurrency behavior, audit event, errors, rate limit, privacy classification, retention, and tests.

## Contract workflow

1. Link the endpoint to approved requirements in [BRD](../BRD.md), [modules](../MODULES.md), or [user stories](../USER_STORY.md).
2. Define the contract according to [API standards](API-STANDARDS.md), then include it in the generated OpenAPI schema once the endpoint is implemented.
3. Review security and privacy implications.
4. Implement backend and frontend service adapters against the same contract.
5. Add backend, contract, and relevant frontend tests before marking it available.
6. Complete the [frontend adapter handoff](API-STANDARDS.md#frontend-adapter-handoff) before replacing any mock/local service with the backend endpoint.
